#### SETUP USERS
# Since tractor is in a container, and this is a POC project, we aren't concerned about user account rights
RUN useradd tractor
RUN usermod -a -G wheel tractor
# centos is a default user account for sub processes
RUN useradd centos
RUN usermod -a -G wheel centos
####

# Not sure if it's needed, but a makefile was used in a sanity check render jobs
RUN yum install -y make 

#### SUDO
# Doing things like mount commands can require sudo
RUN yum install -y sudo
# A slightly modified sudoers file was made for NFS mounting and such
ADD sudoers /etc/sudoers
# Adds config to avoid the first time sudo lecure when used in a script
ADD privacy /etc/sudoers.d/privacy
####

#### SETUP ROOT'S BASH PROFILE
# For convenience we might want to start the container manually, or exec into a running instance
# and run prman and such. If so, environment variables such as the path
# need to be properly setup. Thus If doing a docker or dcos exec, 
# you mush use "bash -l" as the command.
# However we need to remember to update .bash_profile if we add/change env vars
# TODO move all env vars to this section for easier maintenance, dupe parent
# containers
ADD root-bashprofile /root/.bash_profile
# To get this profile to be used, bash -l must be launched, so we'll
# make it the default CMD. Note we won't use an ENTRYPOINT
# This means we can just "docker run -it joshbav/tractor" and have the right
# environment, such as the right path.
CMD bash -l
